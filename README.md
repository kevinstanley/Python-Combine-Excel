# Python-Combine-Excel
Combine a folder of multiple xls files into one master file and append the filename that each line came from

Has a few options for how to read the excel files. Uncomment the one you wish to use and comment out the one currently in use to use a different method.

This script also appends a column on the far left with the filename that the original line came from - this is useful when converting excel files to add to a sql database since you can see the original file the line is from.
